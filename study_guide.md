## The Internet

### What is the Internet

A _network_ is any 2 or more computers connected to each other and configured in a way that they can communicate,

The _Internet_ is a vast 'network of networks', wherein local networks are connected together by way way of routers. The internet is comprised of both the physical infrastructure that enables inter-connectivity between hosts, and the logical protocols that defines how the transmission of data between hosts is facilitated.

### How does the internet work

The Internet is often easiest to conceive of when abstracted into a systems of layers, with the bottom most layer being the physical infrastructure that signals are transported across, and the logical layers on top of that being protocols that govern the transmission of data across the physical layer. At each of the logical layers a protocol is utilized to encapsulate data from the layer above it and perform a specific service in the process of networked communication.
