# The Internet

## What is the Internet?

- Network
- LAN/WLAN
- Inter-network communication
- Network of Networks

## Protocols

- What is a protocol?
- Common internet communication protocols
- Main reasons there are so many protocols for network communication
  - Protocols for different aspects of communication
  - Different protocols for the same aspect of communication

## A Layered System

- Why layering systems are beneficial
- most popular
  - OSI Model
  - TCT/IP(DoD)
- Data Encapsulation in terms of network model protocol layers
  - Protocol Data Unit(PDU)
  - Header and Trailer
  - Data Payload

## The Physical Network

- Purpose of the physical layer
- There are physical limitations to a networks capabilities and have an effect on how protocols function up at the conceptual level
- Bits and Signals
- Characteristics of a physical network
  - Latency
    - propagation delay
    - transmission delay
    - processing delay
    - queuing delay
    - last-mile latency
    - round-trip time
    - network hops
  - Bandwidth
  - Limitations of the physical network

## The Link/Data Link Layer

- Purpose of the link/data link layer
- Ethernet protocol
  - Ethernet Frames
    - preamble and Start of Frame Delimiter(SFD/SOF)
    - source and destination MAC address
    - length
    - DSAP, SSAP, Control
    - data payload
    - frame check sequence
  - Interframe Gap
